# Computer-Graphics-Project
This project was implemented for the Computer Graphics module in the MSc in Computer Games Technology that I completed in 2020. Our task was to create 3D graphics scene taking place along a pre-programmed route, using OpenGL, C++ and GLSL with the Windows API and programming it in Visual Studio.
